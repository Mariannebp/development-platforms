## Introduction

CodeWhisperer is a machine learning powered tool that helps developer productivity directly in their IDEs. Based on the previous code and comments in the developers IDE, CodeWhisperer will generate recommendations with what it predicts would be useful code snippets or comments for you to use as you write code. The developer can choose whether they want to accept one of these recommendations, or continue writing their own code. 

CodeWhisperer also has the ability to scan the developers code for security issues.


## Brief History

CodeWhisperer is a fairly new tool from Amazon, and therefore has a very brief history so far:

	- June 2022 - Public preview released. This is open for free for developers worldwide while in its preview period.
	- November 2022 - Added support for two new programming languages; C# and Typescript.

At the time this is written, it has not yet been released any information on the expected date for the full release and what the costs might be.


## Features

CodeWhisperer has several features that enhance the programme and/or help the developer code efficiently, clean and safe. Let's take a look at some of them; 

#### Supports popular languages and IDEs
Even though CodeWhisperer is relatively new, it already provides support for several programming languages and IDEs. It can be integrated with multiple IDEs:
	- Visual Studio Code
	- AWS Cloud 9
	- AWS Lambda
	- JetBrains

The languages it supports are
	- TypeScript
	- C#
	- Java
	- JavaScript
  - Python

#### Customized code
Amazons CodeWhisperer is trained on various data sources such as open-source code and Amazon.com. With this training the tool will generate suggestions based on analysis of current and previous code and comments in the developers IDE, and the contextual information. Here, contextual information refers to the current file and the cursor location.

As the developer types, CodeWhisperer will generate code recommendations that it predicts that can be useful for the developer, and that matches their patterns and styles. The developer may always choose to either except one of the recommendations given, or just continue writing.
